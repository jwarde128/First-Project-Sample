# First-Project-Sample
I am using the text of a linguistics paper to work on worflow in GitHub. 

The paprer is entitled: The whole, entire thing drives me crazy...
In many situations it appears that the words "whole" and "entire" are completely synonymous. There are however cases where the usage of one or the other seems preferable. THe paper desctibes these circumstances.
